1) Implement a dynamically sized array in a class called DynamicArray.

2) A production version of this class would be optimized and do a lot of error
checking. Don't worry about these things in your implementation, just get it
working. I'll try to teach you about error checking in a later project.

3) Create a test suite that fully tests the public interface.
  - Either as text files or as a C++ program
  
4) Write a Makefile that compiles the project.

5) You may add any private variables and methods you want, but don't modify
the public interface.
